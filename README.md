### CoderDojo Zen
Initially a basic Dojo listing manager. We plan to enhance and add features down 
the line. You can help us make it better by forking this project, adding stuff and then issuing
a pull request back to us!

### Some things to add/hack/dream about
- User settings
- Improved admin panel
- Improved overall Dojo list w/ search
- Mutliple admins on a Dojo
- If country == US, have states also.

### Zen is built on and uses:
